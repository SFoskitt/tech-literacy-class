This is a really good Android overview and even covers some topics about Google accounts.


## Here's what we covered:

### Three buttons on the Android home screen
- Overview, Back, Home

### Gestures -
- Swipe down from the top ("window shade") to access the phone status (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Data, Airplane Mode, etc.) and to access the Settings (the gear icon).

- Other things we talked about here:
    - Leaving the Data turned on (not Wi-Fi) can burn through your cell phone plan data allotment if you're not careful
    - Leaving the Bluetooth or Location (GPS) or Wi-Fi (when you're not near a wireless router) turned on can burn through phone battery if they are not needed


### Lock Screens - 
- It is important to make sure your phone is secured - either with a swipe pattern or with a pin lock - just in case your phone walks away when you're not looking
  - Lock Screen settings can be found using the Swipe Down, then click on the Settings gear icon


### Share Icon - 
You'll see this icon in many applications but its functionality is "context sensitive" which means depending where you are and what app you're in, this Share icon will provide different options.
- Example:
  - If you're looking at a website and click the share icon in the browser you may get options to share the URL of the website by text message or email
  - If you're looking at photos on your phone and click the share icon in the app then you may get options to share the photo by text, email, or Google drive


### Contacts -
- It is important to remember that a new contact can be saved to EITHER the phone hardware or to the Google account.
  - If your contacts are saved to the phone then you change phones, the contacts may not be available to transfer to the new phone
  - If your contacts are saved to the Google account then these will be available to transfer to a new phone AND they are available online


### Emergency calls -
- Your phone should be able to call 911 (and maybe an emergency contact) even if you are out of range of your cell provider or out of cell minutes


### Text Messages -
- Ordinary, plain text messages are called SMS - Short Message Service - and these are included in many cell phone plans
- Sending media with text messages are called MMS - Multimedia Messaging Service - and these use both cell phone AND data! It's important to remember this if you're on a limited data plan, sending too many GIFS or photos by text message can use up data


### Google Play Store -
- This is where you go to download and install applications to your phone
- It is important to clean up any unused applications and their data by uninstalling old applications now and then. This saves space on your phone and saves your phone's processor from becoming bogged down.


### Google Photos -
- This is the default photo application on your Android phone. Normally these photos will upload to your Google account so they are backed up, but it is important to check if there is a required setting for this - in some cases it is not automatic.
- The "Gallery" application is not synch'd to the Google account but your pics may appear in both applications.


### SD Cards -
- If your phone offers this option it can be helpful to store more information on your phone
- SD cards for phones are very tiny and sometimes cost as little as $10


### Google Drive -
- Google accounts (<your-name@gmail.com>) provides lots of free benefits including Document Storage called Google Drive. You can save PDF documents or other types of documents to Google Drive. We'll talk more about this in a future class.


### Backup and Sync -
- This is a built-in feature of Android phones that will back up MOST - but not all - data from your phone. 
  - Example: Depending on what text messaging app you use, sometimes text messages do not sync. 
- Some application log in information or application information does NOT back up
- In spite of this it is a good idea to set your phone to do backups automatically or to do this yourself periodically (every couple months?)
